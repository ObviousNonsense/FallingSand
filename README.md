# Falling Sand Sim

Just a basic falling sand simulator I'm making for fun to practise p5/processing, Javascript, and maybe some HTML & CSS.

[You can play with it here](https://obviousnonsense.github.io/FallingSand/)

##  To Do:
- Clean up UI
- Add button to reset sim
- Add button to resize canvas
- Add Particle types:
    - Generators
        - Water
        - Sand
    - Plant/Wood: Consumes water and grows. Burns.
    - Fire
    - Steam
    - Smoke
- Improve performance? I've tried multiple things to increase the number of particles that can be drawn without dropping frames, but I think I'm at the limit of what I can do with p5/HTML canvas.
